3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - The database is now integrated into the website, and we will be doing integration tests. 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Now that the database is integrated into the website, the main parts of project are complete. Some tweaking can be done to make the data more clear, or to fix up the website to look nicer
  but we are almsot done.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Need to figure out why NGINX webserver doesn't like doing logic other than serving webpages (if physical network server is fixed)
  - Integration tests
  - Writing more tests
  - Writing the final report
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - The physical server that was used at Graham's house to serve websites from their network broke, so we are no longer able to host online until it is fixed. Luckily,
  the project will primarily be used by Graham at his house, so running it locally will work for testing and initial use.
