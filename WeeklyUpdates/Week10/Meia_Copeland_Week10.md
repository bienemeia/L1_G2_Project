  - Finished msot of my tasks. 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I have finished most of my big tasks so far, and the data from the hives are available and processed.
  - The camera stream has been relegated to our 'stretch goals' as we didn't have the time we thought we would to implement it.
  - Frustrated with our webserver struggling to access databases while also serving webpages. Have found some resources online to try and fix it. Hopefully it is not too difficult.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Need to figure out why NGINX webserver doesn't like doing logic other than serving webpages
  - Continue setting up charts of data on website
  - If time, set up camera live stream
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No blockers at the moment for my tasks.
