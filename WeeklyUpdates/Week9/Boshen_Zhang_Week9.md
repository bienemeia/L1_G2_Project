3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Finishing up in total six different page building, home page, tool page, video page, permission page, data page and login page
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I realize that just using html and css is not enough to reach our targets, the icons in tool page should be able to slide instead of static
  - I need to learn the relevant JavaScript knowledge to make the icons moving and grab data dynamically.
  - The project is pretty time consuming at least for my part, not as easy as you see.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Icons in control page should be controlled on and off by sliding just like the unlock switch on old version iphone.
  - Leaning JavaScript to implement the real time video playing.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing blocked me so far, time is always urgent.
