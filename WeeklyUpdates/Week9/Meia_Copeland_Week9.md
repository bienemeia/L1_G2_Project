  - The SQLite DB is now a lot easier to work with, and I feel more comfortable with different querying techniques.

  - I feel like using the local DB will be a lot easier for the website than pulling the data from firebase, which was causing issues.

  - Process data into weekly, monthly, and yearly averages.
  - Set up webserver to serve local DB data to web page.
